# 👨‍💻 Coders of Delhi — Pure Python Data Science Project

A complete end-to-end data science internship simulation project — using **only raw Python** (no libraries like Pandas or NumPy). The project simulates a social media platform called **CodeBook**, and includes:

- Data exploration
- Cleaning messy user data
- “People You May Know” friend suggestion system
- “Pages You Might Like” recommendation engine

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Load & explore user data from a JSON dump  
- 🧹 Clean data (remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize formats)  
- 👥 Suggest friends based on mutual connections  
- 📄 Recommend pages using collaborative filtering  
- ✅ All done using **pure Python only**
